# one-punch-py
Web scraper for fetching images and saving them all in a pdf.

Very easy to use, only thing that might need changing is the directory to save the pdfs. By default, it will save downloaded pdfs into a directory named 'files' in the same directory the script is in (will create this directory if it doesn't exist).
Only tested on windows, will probably break if it's run on a mac.

After setting your desired directory and ensuring you have all the required libraries, just run the file using Python3 and you'll be away.
